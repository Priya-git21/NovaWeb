## Overview
Welcome to my meticulously crafted a React-based portfolio website 'NovaWeb' that embodies a minimalist, dark-themed interface. This single-page application guarantees rapid loading times and responsiveness across all devices. It seamlessly presents my web development skills, showcases recent projects with live view links, and their git hub repositories and provides a user-friendly contact form directly linked to my email. Effortless navigation is facilitated by smooth scrolling and a well-structured navigation bar. Visitors can easily connect with me through GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email. The portfolio embodies simplicity, professionalism, and accessibility in every aspect, offering a cohesive and engaging user experience.
